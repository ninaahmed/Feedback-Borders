## Add an ASCII art border around your text

---

Sample formatted art is located in art.txt. Replace the array on line 33 with the art you'd like to use.

(Line starts with `rep = ` )

---

Right now, the max line length is 100 characters. You could change this on line 44:

`length = (int) (x / border_len)` where x is whatever max line length you want

I've found that it's best to run border.py locally so the text could be copied to your clipboard.
